# Parking Lot Management System

## Introduction
This project is a Parking Lot Management System implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system manages the parking lot operations such as vehicle entry, exit, and parking slot allocation efficiently.

## Features
1. **Vehicle Entry:** Allows vehicles to enter the parking lot and allocates a parking slot if available.
2. **Vehicle Exit:** Marks the slot as empty when a vehicle exits, making it available for future vehicles.
3. **Parking Slot Allocation:** Allocates the nearest available parking slot based on vehicle size and availability.
4. **Parking Lot Status:** Displays the current status of the parking lot including occupied and vacant slots.
5. **Parking Lot Initialization:** Initializes the parking lot with a given number of slots during system setup.
6. **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling to manage edge cases such as full parking lot or invalid inputs.

## Requirements
1. Java Development Kit (JDK)
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
